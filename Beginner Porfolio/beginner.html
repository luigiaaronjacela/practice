				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p> I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Electronics Engineering from the Technological University of the Philippines. After passing the board exam, I worked as a Test Engineer in the manufacturing industry for two years. I then transitioned to a Design Engineer role in the automation industry, where I spent four years. However, I found that growth opportunities in my company were limited, and there were few chances for upskilling. This led me to pursue a career as a Web Developer. I am currently studying to become a full-stack developer, and I hope to find a job as a Web Developer within this year. </p>
